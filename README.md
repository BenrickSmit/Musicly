# Musicly
Musicly is a short python script used to organise mp3 files into their related artist and then album folders.

# Usage
Simply open the python file in the way you are most comfortable with -- likely with python main.py -- and select the folder
you wish to have sorted. Musicly will do all the work for you, and inform you of it's progress. It doesn't copy the files outright, so no
music will be lost, however, it might be good to have a backup-folder just in case.

# NOTICE
Have a backup folder ready, should you not be happy with Musicly's work. No files will be lost as it uses python's built in library
for moving files.
